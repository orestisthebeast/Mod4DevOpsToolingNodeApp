MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND TESTS and installing venv and stuff in the pipeline

How to build a nodeJS application
research
npm start or npm install etc

Lab 5 - Jenkins credentials 

There's 2 different credentials that we want to add
We need a GH cred and a Dockerhub cred
We'll be pushing to docker hub. 
Can have an envar section and get secret text credential
then build an nginx container and print out the secret text rather than default html
Then push image to dockerhub

We want it to live in docker hub and kubernetes will pull from there on Monday 

We need to test it - test the login with Docker 

Then lab 6 - webhook

Click 1 button to create webhook, then link repo
Just follow lab instructions

Stretch goal - make it nicer, don't just rum the script, break it up into sections

Do Docker compose this pm
